### Description

This is almost a fully dynamic Buttonbar. This control is not finished yet... i know there are still bugs and problems. If there is enough response i will finish and put some other things in it. Still have many ideas... :)

I would also like to thank other programmers from PSC because not all of the code is from my hand.
 
### More Info
 
In the function set groups there is a call to a function NoFocusRect. Put this in comment until compilation, otherwise you can't use the stop button in vb
